      <h1>Neural Networks in Artificial Intelligence</h1>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence is making waves in the technological world. Nearly everyone has heard discussions about AI, but what exactly is it? How does it work? Where is it being implemented in our society? And why is it something we should be paying attention to? If you're confused about what exactly is artificial intelligence and how it plays a role in our lives, don't worry! You're in the right place. This website covers a wide range of topics relating to artificial intelligence and its implementation--most importantly, providing an understanding of the complex Neural Networks that power the technology of the future. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Below are just a few examples of AI's reach within our society. Each section will go into depth about the technology itself, its history, and what we can look forward to seeing in the near future. A great way to understand how all of these technological feats have been achieved is by understanding the artificial neural networks behind the technology itself, so be sure to check out our interactive example of the simplest form of a neural network, the perceptron!

      <!--ChatGPT Explanation-->
      <h1 id="chatgpt">ChatGPT</h1>
      <p>One of the most prevalent examples of neural networks being used commercially is ChatGPT. It's nearly impossible to go anywhere on the internet without seeing it in use or hearing it mentioned. Created by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT is a powerful language-learning model that can answer questions and have conversations with its users. It is such a landmark in AI technology because of how eerily similar it is to a real person. But how does it work? And how do neural networks play a role in creating a tool as powerful as ChatGPT?
      <br>In order to answer these questions, let's first look at the "GPT" in ChatGPT. "GPT" stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer". The G and the P are pretty self explanatory--it generates results based off of data it was trained on previously. "Transformer", on the other hand, is less intuitive. It refers to the transformer architecture that ChatGPT is built on.  This is where neural network architecture comes into play, as this transformer network is a variant of the traditional neural network architecture. By utilizing "self-attention"[1] techniques, the transformer is able to revisit words it has already parsed in order to better contextualize their meaning before outputting a response. This is what allows ChatGPT to contextualize input provided by a user in order to provide a (hopefully) helpful response.
      <br>It is important to note that, while ChatGPT's output is incredibly impressive, it is not a reliable source of information. Though it is able to pull information from many different online sources, it only will output what it thinks sounds the most "human" without keeping truth in mind. So, be mindful while using ChatGPT! It is but a tool to help you, not a 100% accurate source of information.
