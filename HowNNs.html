  <!--Interactive Perceptron-->
  <h1 id="perceptron">Perceptron Example and How it works</h1>
  <p>
    The Perceptron is one of the simplest ANN architectures. It's based on a slightly different
    artificial neuron known as a "Threshold Logic Unit" (TLU). Instead of binary on/off values
    for the input and output it is numbers instead. Each input is also associated with a weight. Then the TLU
    computes a weighted sum of its inputs (Sum = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + w3*x3 + ... + wn+xn). The this
    sum is put into either a step function or a signum function. The output is the result of the sum put into the function.
    PICTURE OF WHOLE PROCESS HERE

    Typically when you start using a perceptron by default you set the weights to 0 and the accuracy of the predictions
    is not great. To fix this issue the perceptron is trained which basically just involves finding the right weight values using a training algorithm.
    For every prediction incorrect the training algorithm updates the weight values of perceptron.
    How does the weight update? 
    It updates through the use of a formula (wi = wi,j + lr(yi-yhati)*xi).
    To give more context before explaining the meaning of the values, this formula is used for each weight for as many times as there were wrong predictions. 
    Also each weight from a previous use of the formula carries on over to the next use of the formula
    
    wi represents which weight is being changed
    wi,j represents the previous weight
    lr represents the learning rate
    yi represents the target response
    yhat represents the predicted response
    xi represents the respective weights' corresponding input value.

    <!-- Insert The perceptron model above -->
    <br>How does this perceptron model work? 
        As you can see this perceptron model has four binary inputs (X1,X2,X3,X4)
        
        X1 representing the Overcast of the day has a range of -2 - 1 where -2 is lightning storm, -1 is a rainstorm, 0 is cloudy and 1 is sunny
        X2 is pretty self-explanatory representing Temperature in Fahreheit
        X3 is the Windyness of the day with a range of 1 - 3 with 1 representing 0-10 mph, 2 representing 11-20 mph windspeed and 3 representing Windspeed over 21 mph
        X4 represents the amount of precipitation expected in millimeters. 

        with 0 representing no and 1 representing yes it is nice enough to take a walk.


      <! Write about how we just made a computer basically do the same calculations we do when we wake up and look at the weather app and decided whether it's going to be a nice day or not
